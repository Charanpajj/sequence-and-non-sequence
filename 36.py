a = (10 , 20 , 30)
print(a)
# Output: (10, 20, 30)
# Explanation: Prints the tuple `a` as it is defined.

print(id(a))
# Output: [A unique memory address, e.g., 2049082728944]
# Explanation: This prints the unique memory address of the tuple object `a`.

a = a * 2
# Explanation: The expression `a * 2` performs tuple repetition, which creates a *new* tuple object `(10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30)`. Because tuples are immutable, the original object is not changed. The variable `a` is then reassigned to point to this new object.

print(a)
# Output: (10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30)
# Explanation: Prints the newly created, longer tuple that `a` now references.

print(id(a))
# Output: [A new and different memory address, e.g., 2049082729900]
# Explanation: This prints the memory address of the new tuple object. This address will be different from the original one, proving that a new object was created and the variable was reassigned.
