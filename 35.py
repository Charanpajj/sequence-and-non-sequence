a = ()
print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'tuple'>
# Explanation: This prints the data type of the variable 'a', which is a tuple.

print(a)
# Output: ()
# Explanation: This prints the empty tuple that was created using the tuple literal syntax `()`.

print(len(a))
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the tuple, which is 0 since it is empty.

b = tuple()
print(b)
# Output: ()
# Explanation: This prints the empty tuple that was created using the `tuple()` constructor with no arguments.

print(len(b))
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the tuple `b`, which is also 0.
