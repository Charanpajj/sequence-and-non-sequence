a = """"Hyd"""
print(a)
# Output: Hyd
# Explanation: This statement assigns the string `"""Hyd"` to `a`. 

print(a)
# Output: (This line would not be reached due to the SyntaxError above)
# Explanation: If the previous line had been valid, this would print the value of 'a'.

print(len(a))
# Output: (This line would not be reached due to the SyntaxError above)
# Explanation: If 'a' were a valid string, this would print its length.

print(a[0])
# Output: (This line would not be reached due to the SyntaxError above)
# Explanation: If 'a' were a valid string, this would print its first character.

print("""Hyd""")
# Output: Hyd
# Explanation: This is a valid multi-line string literal defined by triple double quotes `"""`. It prints the string 'Hyd'.

b = """""Hyd"""
# Output: SyntaxError: invalid syntax
# Explanation: Similar to the first assignment, the sequence of five double quotes `"""""` at the beginning is not a valid string literal definition in Python, resulting in a `SyntaxError`. Variable 'b' would not be assigned.

print(b)
# Output: (This line would not be reached due to the SyntaxError above)
# Explanation: If the previous line had been valid, this would print the value of 'b'.

print(len(b))
# Output: (This line would not be reached due to the SyntaxError above)
# Explanation: If 'b' were a valid string, this would print its length.
