a = {1 , 'Hyd' , False , True , 0.0 , '' , 1.0 , 0}
print(a)
# Output: {False, 1, '', 'Hyd'}  (The order may vary)
# Explanation: Sets store only unique elements. Python's set treats certain values as equal for uniqueness checks:
# - `False`, `0`, and `0.0` are all considered the same. Only one is stored.
# - `True`, `1`, and `1.0` are all considered the same. Only one is stored.
# - The empty string `''` and the string `'Hyd'` are unique.
# Therefore, the set contains only four unique elements: one for the group of zeros/False, one for the group of ones/True, and the two unique strings.

print(len(a))
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The `len()` function returns the number of unique elements in the set, which, as explained above, is 4.

print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'set'>
# Explanation: This confirms the data type of the variable `a` is a set.
