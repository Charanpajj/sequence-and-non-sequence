a = {}
print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'dict'>
# Explanation: The `{}` literal syntax, when empty, creates an empty dictionary.

print(len(a))
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The `len()` function returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary, which is 0.

print(a)
# Output: {}
# Explanation: This prints the literal representation of an empty dictionary.

b = dict()
print(type(b))
# Output: <class 'dict'>
# Explanation: The `dict()` constructor with no arguments also creates an empty dictionary.

print(len(b))
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The length of the empty dictionary `b` is also 0.

print(b)
# Output: {}
# Explanation: This prints the literal representation of the empty dictionary created by `dict()`.
